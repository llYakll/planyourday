# Work Day Scheduler
## Descriptiion
The Work Day Scheduler is a simple calendar application designed to help users organize their work day effectively. With intuitive time blocks for standard business hours (9 AM to 5 PM), users can input tasks for each hour and save them for later reference. The scheduler dynamically updates to highlight past, present, and future time blocks, providing users with visual cues to manage their time efficiently.

# Features
### Dynamic Time Blocks: 
  Time blocks are generated for each hour from 9 AM to 5 PM, adapting to the current time and allowing users to schedule tasks accordingly.
  
### Color-Coded Visualization: 
  Time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future, providing users with a clear overview of their schedule.
  
### Local Storage Integration: 
  Saved tasks persist even after the page is refreshed or closed, ensuring that users can access their schedule whenever they need it.
  
### User-Friendly Interface: 
  Intuitive layout and styling make it easy for users to input, view, and manage their tasks throughout the work day.

### Color-Coded Visualization:
